			My name is Craig Cockerill. I currently work at <a href="http://masugadesign.com">Masuga Design</a> as a designer & front-end developer.

				I'm 25 years old and graduated from Ferris State University with a degree in Graphic Design. While I'm young I've had nothing short of a wealth of experience. During my time in college I helped redesign the Graphic Design at Ferris State website along with faculty and a small team. All the while maintaining my job at Ferris State Admissions as Junior UI/UX Designer and a Junior Front-End Developer.

				I worked on projects alongside my professor's thesis that eventually was featured in Communication Arts. And in February of this year my team and I won a West Michigan AAF Gold Addy for our work as students for The <a href="http://ferris.edu/smalltownstudio">Small Town Studio</a>.

				Since then I've worked at two small agencies becoming a key member in the entire process. I've worked with local dentists all the way up to clients such as Fox and Adobe. I'm affluent when it comes to both design and development. There's nothing quite as satisfying as bringing my work to life. I was recently invited to host a talk to the Ferris State University AIGA Student Group on the topic of &quot;Designing with Developers.&quot;
			</p>
			<p>
				I currently live in Grand Rapids with my partner and our two cats. I'm currently in the exploration of a side project involving your activity levels and your desk chair &mdash; but that's all I'll say. I'm deeply into vintage hi-fi and music at large.
