			My name is Craig Cockerill. I currently work at <a href="http://piazza.com">Piazza</a> as a designer & front-end engineer.

		<div class="col-1-3">
			<p>
				I am a classically trained designer — with a formal education in production, print design, typography, UI/UX, interaction design, and even the beginning of front-end development. I've been fascinated by computers for as long as I remember and I've been writing code since I was 11 — while my first website most definitely was not more than any GeoCities site. It was not only a place for me to put up animated .gif's I made, and was the beginning of an infinite passion.
			</p>
			<p>
				During college I excelled enough to work on redesigning and doing front-end for portions of our Graphic Design Program's website with faculty. While my education allowed for ample education as a generalist, I was also able to begin to specialize on the web as both designer and front-end.

				Since graudating I worked at two agencies in Michigan where I designed and developed website for a variety of clients — local dentists all the way up to the likes of Fox, Scripps Network, and Adobe. During the same time period at my previous employer we were maintaining Devot-ee — The Exhaustive Resource for ExpressionEngine, and I was doing initial inception, design, and development of Lamplighter.
			</p>
			<p>
				After wanting a new challenge and escaping a failing economy I moved out the Bay Area and began working at Piazza where I help student get unstuck, and more recently, with Piazza Careers, help connect them with career opportunities with the best companies in Silicon Valley.
