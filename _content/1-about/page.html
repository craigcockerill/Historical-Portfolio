      Passion is an understatement.
    </h1>
    <p>
      I'm a UI/UX designer &amp; front-end engineer living in bright &amp; sunny Palo Alto, CA with my fianc&eacute; and our two <del>children</del> cats.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've had an interest in design and technology from a very young age. I remember watching a documentary when I was twelve about Jobs, Wozniak, Bushnell, &amp; Gates and blindly trying to teach myself BASIC. Later in grade school I would build &#40;admittedly terrible&#41; websites for various classes &mdash; this was the beginning of an endless fascination. A decade later I graduated with a B.S. in Graphic Design.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was during that time I would begin mocking my work in code as a means to an end &mdash; though the more I learned, the more I found joy bringing my work to life. I worked closely with a member of my faculty who was a designer turned developer to foster my skillset. Post graduation I immediately started designing and building websites for a wide clientele.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now I live and work in the Bay Area and couldn't be happier. Aside from design I deep love of music, hi-fi audio, vinyl, gaming, furniture, biking. More often than not I can be caught spending time with my fianc&eacute; and our two cats.
