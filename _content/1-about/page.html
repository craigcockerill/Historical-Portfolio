			My name is Craig Cockerill. I'm a UI Engineer at <a href="https://piazza.com" target="_blank">Piazza</a>.

				I'm 25 years old and graduated from Ferris State University with a degree in Graphic Design. While I'm young I've had nothing short of a wealth of experience. During my time in college I helped redesign the Graphic Design at Ferris State website along with faculty and a small team. All the while maintaining my job at Ferris State Admissions as Junior UI/UX Designer and a Junior Front-End Developer.

				I worked on projects alongside my professor's thesis &mdash; which was later featured in Communication Arts. And in February of this year my team and I won a West Michigan AAF Gold Addy for our work as students for The <a href="http://ferris.edu/smalltownstudio">Small Town Studio</a>.

				Since then I've worked at two small agencies becoming a key member in the entire process. I've worked with local dentists, but I've also had clients such as Fox and Adobe. I'm affluent when it comes to both design and development. There's nothing quite as satisfying as bringing my work to life. I've since moved West to work for Piazza &mdash; where I help disrupt the education space.

				I currently live in Palo Alto with my fianc&eacute; and our two <del>children</del> cats.
