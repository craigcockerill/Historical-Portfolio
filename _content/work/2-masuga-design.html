<p>
  When I started at Masuga Design we had just shifted from a two man shop to a five person team. In order to get myself and others aquainted with our development process we decided it was time for a redesign. We also felt it was necessary to better align our web presence given the new capacity and capabilities.

<p>
  The site was previously built on ExpressionEngine and was for the initial redeisgn &mdash; but after much consideration we decided to port the site to Statamic. Which happened to be one of the best decisions we made given the complexity of the site. What tooks us weeks with ExpressionEngine became mere days under Statamic.

  Working alongside coworkers I updated our identity, crafted new content, shot all appropriate photography, and rebuilt the experience from the ground up. The site was a huge success for our company and was featured by many blogs and even landed us new clientelle.
