  After building internal dashboards for our own office stats â€” we decided there was something more to this idea &mdash; it began to evolve into its' own product. Cue Lamplighter. After rapid ideation and planning &mdash; I had created the identity &mdash; we were ready to begin taking signups.

  I wanted to replicate the intimate nature of a small web shop, and decided to shoot video for the site alongside crafting our message &mdash; Lamplighter was born. Integrating with Campaign Monitor the signup page was an overwhelming success &mdash; it was widely publicized on design blogs and generated hundreds of signups even in its infancy.
