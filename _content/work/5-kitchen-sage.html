<p>
  This was a project through AIGA West Michigan's Design for Good &mdash; though I wasn't actually on the team for this project. The founder of the organization &mdash; Tommy Fitzgerald &mdash; delivered his introduction at the start of the event, I was enamored. After learning from colleagues that there was no developer on their team, I told Tommy &quot;I'm doing your site, regardless of what happens this weekend. You will have a website.&quot;
</p>
<p>
  Fortunately they were able to borrow a developer to install Wordpress with a base theme, yet there wasn't anyone to iron out a lot of the details after the weekend. So once I wrapped up my work for the Greater Grand Rapids Bicycle Coalition I spent the next several weeks with Tommy working out of his restaurant and home to get his site done and ready for the summer classes that were only a few months away.

<p>
  While I did not design the entire site, I did finalize some of the interface, clean up the &quot;responsive&quot; quirks inherent in themes, and make portions of the site retina capable.
