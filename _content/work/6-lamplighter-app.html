  <p>
    After several meetings and long lists of potential features, I sketched, wireframed, then began drafting the interface in Illustrator. It was designed with flexibility in mind knowing that at any moment we could radically change the feature set.
  </p>
  <p>
  Another important consideration made with this interface was accomodating individuals with color blindness. With a color blind coworker, it was clear that any sort of indicator needed multiple modes for recognition just for us to use it.

  <p>
    Whether that be color and quantity, or color and type &mdash; I wanted to make sure that anyone in your studio would have no problem navigating the data rich application.
