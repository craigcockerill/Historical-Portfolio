  <h1>Hi, my name is <a href="#">Craig</a>. I'm a designer taking joy in the build.</h1>

  <p>I'm currently a product designer and front-end engineer for <a href="#">Piazza</a> and <a href="#">Piazza Careers</a> â€” a platform that helps students from their first course to their first career.</p>

  <p>In a time, not so long ago, I lived in Michigan. When I was there I worked at several studios &mdash; with clients ranging from your local family dentist all the way up to corporations like <a href="#">Fox Networks</a>, &amp; <a href="#">Adobe</a>. During that same time I also worked on the intial inception, design, and development of <a href="#">Lamplighter</a>.</p>

  <p>When I was in school I led small teams alongside faculty to redesign portions of our <a href="#">graphic design program site</a>, create <a href="#">art installations</a> that highlighted the wasted potential in vacant spaces, and <a href="#">won an award</a> for some of our <a href="#">earliest client work</a>.</p>
