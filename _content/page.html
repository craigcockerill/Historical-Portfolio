<p>Hi, I'm Craig. I design and build internet.</p>

<p>I'm currently a product designer and front-end engineer for Piazza and Piazza Careers â€” a platform that helps students from their first course to their first career.</p>

<p>In a time not so long ago I lived in Michigan where I worked at several studios. My clients ranged from your family dentist all the way up to Fox Networks, & Adobe. During that same time I also worked on the intial inception, design, and development of Lamplighter.</p>

<p>Before I graduated I led small teams alongside faculty to redesign and develop portions of our graphic design program site, create art installations to highlight the wasted potential in vacant spaces (it got some coverage), and even won an award for some of our earliest client work.</p>
