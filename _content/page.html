  <h1>Hi, my name is <a href="/about">Craig</a>. I'm a designer taking joy in the build.</h1>
  <p>I'm a UI Designer for <a href="https://www.plastiq.com/" target="_blank">Plastiq</a> &mdash; where anyone can pay for anything using their credit card.</p>
  <p>Not so long ago, I worked for <a href="https://piazza.com/" target="_blank">Piazza</a> &amp; <a href="https://recruiting.piazza.com/" target="_blank">Piazza Careers</a>. Before that, I lived in Michigan where I worked for several studios &mdash; with clients ranging from your family dentist all the way up to <a href="http://www.fox.com/" target="_blank">Fox Networks</a>, &amp; <a href="http://www.adobe.com/" target="_blank">Adobe</a>.</p>
  <p>While in school I led small teams alongside faculty to redesign portions of our <a href="http://graphicdesign.ferris.edu/see/creator/93" target="_blank">graphic design program site</a>, create <a href="http://grafikintervention.com/interventions/grand-rapids/" target="_blank">art</a> <a href="http://grafikintervention.com/interventions/big-rapids/" target="_blank">installations</a> that highlighted the wasted potential in vacant spaces, and even won an award for some of our <a href="http://www.ferris.edu/smalltownstudio/" target="_blank">earliest client work</a>.</p>
