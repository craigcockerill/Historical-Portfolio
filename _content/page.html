  <h1>Hi, my name is <a href="/about">Craig</a>. I'm a designer taking joy in the build.</h1>

  <p>I'm currently a product designer and front-end engineer for <a href="https://piazza.com/" target="_blank">Piazza</a> and <a href="https://recruiting.piazza.com/" target="_blank">Piazza Careers</a> â€” a platform that helps students from their first course to their first career.</p>

  <p>In a time not so long ago, I lived in Michigan. When I was there I worked at several studios &mdash; with clients ranging from your local family dentist all the way up to corporations like <a href="http://www.fox.com/" target="_blank">Fox Networks</a>, &amp; <a href="http://www.adobe.com/" target="_blank">Adobe</a>. During that same time I also worked on the intial inception, design, and development of <a href="https://lamplighter.io/" target="_blank">Lamplighter</a>.</p>

  <p>While in school I led small teams alongside faculty to redesign portions of our <a href="http://graphicdesign.ferris.edu/see/creator/93" target="_blank">graphic design program site</a>, create <a href="http://grafikintervention.com/interventions/grand-rapids/" target="_blank">art</a> <a href="http://grafikintervention.com/interventions/big-rapids/" target="_blank">installations</a> that highlighted the wasted potential in vacant spaces, and even <a href="http://www.ferris.edu/business/stories/addy-awards" target="_blank">won an award</a> for some of our <a href="http://www.ferris.edu/smalltownstudio/" target="_blank">earliest client work</a>.</p>
