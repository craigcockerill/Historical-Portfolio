<p>Hi, I'm Craig. I design and build internet.</p>

<p>I'm currently a product designer and front-end engineer for <a href="#">Piazza</a> and <a href="#">Piazza Careers</a> â€” a platform that helps students from their first course to their first career.</p>

<p>In a time not so long ago I lived in Michigan where I worked at several studios. My clients ranged from your family dentist all the way up to <a href="#">Fox Networks</a>, & <a href="#">Adobe</a>. During that same time I also worked on the intial inception, design, and development of <a href="#">Lamplighter</a>.</p>

<p>When I was still in school I led small teams alongside faculty to redesign and develop portions of our <a href="#">graphic design program site</a>, create <a href="#">art installations</a> to highlight the wasted potential in vacant spaces (it got some <a href="#">coverage</a>), and even <a href="#">won an award</a> for some of our <a href="#">earliest client work</a>.</p>
